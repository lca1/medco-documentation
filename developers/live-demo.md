# Live Demo

The live demo of MedCo is available at [https://medco-demo.epfl.ch](https://medco-demo.epfl.ch). The profile `test-local-3nodes` with a custom configuration is used.

## Update demo version

Connect with SSH to the machine, with the `lca1` account. Ask MickaÃ«l or Joao to set up your SSH public key there. 

### Get the latest version

Ensure the configuration specific to the MedCo stays \(see next section\).

```bash
cd /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes
make down
git pull
```

### Configuration update

Update the configuration according to the following examples. For the passwords, use the same as defined in the previous deployments.

{% code title="/home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes/.env" %}
```bash
MEDCO_NODE_HOST=medco-demo.epfl.ch
MEDCO_NODE_HTTP_SCHEME=https
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=xxx
PGADMIN_PASSWORD=xxx
KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=xxx
I2B2_WILDFLY_PASSWORD=xxx
I2B2_SERVICE_PASSWORD=xxx
I2B2_USER_PASSWORD=xxx
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="/home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes/docker-compose.yml" %}
```yaml
  glowing-bear-medco:
    environment:
      - "GB_FOOTER_TEXT=Disclaimer: This demo complies with the EPFL regulations and guidelines regarding the storage and use of personal data: https://www.epfl.ch/about/overview/overview/regulations-and-guidelines/"
```
{% endcode %}

### Start deployment

```bash
cd /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes
make up
```

### Load synthetic demo data

Get them from the Google Drive folder and execute the script

```bash
cd /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco
./test/data/download.sh spo_synthetic

./scripts/load-spo-i2b2-data.sh localhost i2b2medcosrv0 medcoconnectorsrv0
./scripts/load-spo-i2b2-data.sh localhost i2b2medcosrv1 medcoconnectorsrv1
./scripts/load-spo-i2b2-data.sh localhost i2b2medcosrv2 medcoconnectorsrv2
```

## Update certificate

The certificate is provided by Let's Encrypt and valid for a period of 3 months, it thus needs regular renewing. First ensure that the configuration located in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/medco-demo.epfl.ch.conf` is correct.

Then as the user `root`, renew the certificate:

```bash
certbot renew
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/medco-demo.epfl.ch/fullchain.pem \
    /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes/configuration/certificate.crt
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/medco-demo.epfl.ch/privkey.pem \
    /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes/configuration/certificate.key
```

Finally as the user `lca1` restart the stack:

```bash
cd /home/lca1/medco-repo/medco/deployments/test-local-3nodes
make stop
make up
```
